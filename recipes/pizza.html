    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat 2 pie plates with non-stick cooking spray. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            Place ground beef, onion, and garlic in a skillet over medium heat. Cook until beef is evenly browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Season beef with chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            Lay one tortilla in each pie plate, and cover with a layer of refried beans. Spread 1/2 of the seasoned ground beef over each one, and then cover with a second tortilla. Bake in the preheated oven until tortillas are crisp, about 10 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            Remove pizzas from the oven and set aside to cool slightly. Then spread 1/2 of the salsa over each top tortilla. Cover each pizza with 1/2 of the Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses. Place 1/2 of the tomatoes, 1/2 of the green onions, and 1/2 of the jalapeño slices onto each one. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 5</h4>
                Return pizzas to the oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 5 to 10 more minutes. Let pizzas cool slightly before slicing each one into 4 pieces. 
        </li>
    </ol>
